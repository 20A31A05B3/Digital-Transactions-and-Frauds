  <h3>DIGITAL PAYMENT FRAUDS</h3>
  <p>In today's digital world, one has to be mindful of the cybercrimes. These criminals are especially targeting users taking the digital route to conduct financial transactions.
    <br><br>
    Digital payments have the dual goal of being more secure and user-friendly than traditional payment methods. Striking a balance between security and seamless payments is now one of the major challenges for banks and financial institutions.
    <br><br>
    Digitization has also led to the mushrooming of fraudsters, who are becoming smarter as they too adopt technology as it evolves. An exponential increase in digital payments owing to the rapid assimilation of technology in our day-to-day lives has contributed to the increase in online fraud. A huge number of people now prefer online modes of payment, which has inspired fraudsters to use innovative ways to dupe customers. Many consumers have fallen prey to these fraudsters by revealing their sensitive information and losing their hard-earned money. Interconnected smart devices and online activity contributed to this trend of payment fraud by making customers more vulnerable to deception.
    <br><br>
    Now a new scam has started. Someone knowingly sends money to your account or Google Pay and calls you to tell you that the money was in your account by mistake and requests that you send the money back to their number.
    <br><br>
    If you send the money back, your account will be hacked. So, if someone has wrongly received money in account, ask the caller to come to the nearest police station with ID proof and take it as cash. Time and again, government has notified through various advertisement platforms, television, radio, through police social media handle to be very vigilant about all kinds of digital frauds.</p>

</div>

<div id="1" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>PHISHING ATTACKS</h3>
  <p>This is the most common online scam that is committed by scamsters. Phishing attacks are conducted by sending text messages, emails and other messaging applications. People receive a message on their mails or messaging applications which look similar to official messages and once the person clicks on the fake message, the scamsters get access to your device and information.
    <br><br>
    The three most common types of phishing scams are: <br><br>
  </p>
  <h4>EMAIL PHISHING</h4>
  <p>The most common form of phishing attacks are conducted via email messages. This type of attack typically involves a fraudster sending an email that informs the recipient that their account has been "compromised" and they need to reset their password. The goal of email phishing is to get the recipient to willingly disclose their private login credentials or any other sensitive information the fraudster might want. 
  </p>
  <h4>VISHING</h4>
  <p>Vishing follows the same concept as phishing attacks, but it's conducted over a voice call. A popular vishing attack is the "extended vehicle warranty" scam. The recipient receives a call informing them that their vehicle's extended warranty is expiring, and they need to disclose their banking credentials to ensure the new warranty is properly set up. 
  </p>
  <h4>SMISHING</h4>
  <p>This is a type of phishing attack that uses SMS text to target unknowing victims. The tactics used in smishing are very similar to how an email phishing attack would play out; the recipient receives a text informing them that their account (online banking, PayPal, etc) has been compromised and they need to share their current login information to gain access to the account. Once the fraudster has the login credentials, they can change the password and block the victim from accessing the account.
  </p>
</div>

<div id="2" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>FAKE WEBSITES</h3>
  <p>Another very common way to defraud people is by using fake websites of famous financial institutions. Scamsters create websites which look similar to the original website and offer lucrative offers to victims to buy financial products. However, if one needs to be vigilant to differentiate between the fake and original websites. Generally, genuine websites have a secure domain and their URLs start with 'HTTPS' and not 'HTTP'
  </p>
</div>
<div id="3" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>QR CODE SCAM</h3>
    <p>Many people have fallen victim to this scam where fraudster clean their bank account using a QR code.
       The moment you list any item on any buying or selling goods platform, many users will show interest in
        buying the product from you at the same price as listed. To take the process further, 
        the user immediately asks for UPI ID, bank account to initiate the payment. 
        Then the user will send a WhatsApp with QR code and the requested amount will be written on it,
         the user will ask you to scan the QR code and enter an OTP on any Digital Payment App to receive the payment. Basically, you will be asked to scan the QR code to receive the money in your account, which will eventually lead to the fraud.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div id="4" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>FAKE DELIVERY-OTP SCAM</h3>
    <p>Scammers will target people who are a frequent online shopper and receive packages.
     A fake guy will show up at your doorstep pretending to be the delivery agent.
      They will state that your package is a pay-on delivery module. 
      If you refuse to take the delivery page they will ask for your contact number and will send an OTP to initiate the cancellation.
       The moment you will click on the unknown link or will share the OTP, your phone will fall vulnerable to the scammers and get hacked.
    </p> 
  </div>
  
  <div id="5" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>MALWARES</h3>
    <p>Through fake customer support, cashback links, or emails, fraudsters convince unsuspecting consumers to install malware, screen mirroring, or remote access apps. Once installed, the compromised device is then used to access financial information and dupe consumers through transactions from their account or cards.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="6" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>UPI FRAUDS</h3>
    <p>Digital payments in India took a huge leap with the introduction of UPI transactions. However, fraudsters were not late to adapt and came up with various ways to defraud consumers. From disguising collect requests as fake cashback offers and QR codes to creating spoofed VPAs for refunds, disaster support, etc., UPI-related frauds are a major menace in the Indian payment ecosystem.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div id="7" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>REFUND FRAUDS</h3>
    <p>Earlier, fraudsters used the dark web to share tips and strategies on forgery and deception, 
      but with the rapid adoption of the internet, fraudsters now offer “Fraud as a Service” (professional refunders),
       who leverage Reddit and Discord as promotional grounds. Over a glut of refunds, consumers collude with refunders,
        who then impersonate consumers to defraud the e-retailers through various methods such as seeking refunds with 
        doctored images claiming substance leaks, a partially empty box, etc. Refund fraud is not only a concern to merchants but also runs the risk of putting consumers’ virtual assets, such as emails, passwords, card details, etc., at risk as refunders offering Fraud-as-a-Service gain access to the buyer’s account.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <div id="8" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>ADVANCED FEE AND WIRE TRANSFER SCAMS</h3>
    <p>These kinds of scams are particularly common as part of spam emails. A criminal will target a business owner or an individual and ask for payment in return for a greater amount of money later. They may, for instance, ask for money to pay bank fees so that you can get millions later on.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div id="9" class="tabcontent">
      <h3>CARD SKIMMING</h3>
      <p>Card skimming involves the illegal copying of a user’s credit or debit card information using a skimming device when the card is swiped for payment.
         The scammers then use the copied information to make fraudulent transactions.</p>
