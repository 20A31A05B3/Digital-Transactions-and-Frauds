            <h1><br>DIGTAL TRANSACTIONS</h1>
            <h2><br>INTRODUCTION<br></h2>
            <p1 class="par"><br>Digital payments are payments done through digital or online modes, with no exchange of hard cash being involved.
               Such a payment, sometimes also called an electronic payment (e-payment), is the transfer of value from one payment account to another
                where both the payer and the payee use a digital device such as a mobile phone, computer, or a credit, debit, or prepaid card.
              <br>A digital payment transaction can happen both on the internet and in person to the payee. For example, if a buyer pays via UPI on 
              an e-commerce website or buys from his local grocer and pays him through UPI while purchasing at the store, both are digital payment transactions. 

              There are various modes of digital payments, including UPI, NEFT, AEPS, mobile wallets, and PoS terminals.</p1><br><br>
                <h2>HOW DIGITAL TRANSACTIONS WORK<br>
                </h2>
                <p2 class="par"><br>A digital transaction converts a traditional cash-operational society to a cashless one. It can be anything from paying for goods at a brick-and-mortar store to transferring money online to making investment trades.<br><br>

                  Here's an example of an everyday transaction that looks quite simple but is actually embedded with digital intricacies every step of the way: 
                  
                  Jane pays cash every time she goes to the grocery store (Fresh Chain). This means that every time she runs out of cash, she has to make a trip to her bank (Future Bank) in order to replenish her wallet.
                   Unfortunately, if she needs some cash after closing hours or on a weekend, she will have to wait until the next workday when Future Bank is open for business.
                    To include Jane in the digital finance world, Future Bank gives Jane a debit card linked automatically to her checking account.
                     The next time Jane goes grocery shopping at Fresh Chain, she swipes her card through a hand-held payment processing device known as a Point of Sale (POS).
                      The payment is made in seconds and Jane goes home satisfied.<br><br>
                  
                  Now let’s look at the behind-the-scenes digital transaction. The debit card issued to Jane is a Visa card. 
                  Visa creates cards like Jane’s which has a magnetic stripe that stores information digitally. 
                  When Jane swipes the magnetic stripe against the POS or payment processor, the transaction information is transferred to Visa.
                   The payment processor acts as the intermediary between Visa and Fresh Chain. Visa makes note of the information received from the payment 
                   processor and forwards it to Future Bank for approval. Future Bank confirms that Jane has the necessary funds in her checking account to 
                   complete her purchase and authorizes the transaction. Visa then relays this information through the POS machine as an authorized transaction.<br><br>
                  
                  The exact amount of the transaction is debited from Jane’s checking account and a percentage of this amount, say 98%, is credited to Fresh Chain’s account.
                   The remaining 2% is shared between Future Bank and Visa as their fee. Although the process seems lengthy, it actually happens in seconds.</p2>
